// Lemonade Change

// Each lemonade at a booth sells for $5. Consumers are lining up to place individual orders, 
// following the billing order. Every consumer will purchase a single lemonade and may pay with a $5, $10, or $20 bill.
// Each customer must receive the appropriate change so that the net transaction is $5. Initially, there is no change available.

// Determine if it is possible to provide the correct change to every customer.
// Return true if the correct change can be given to every customer, and false otherwise.

// Given an integer array bills, where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays,
// return true if the correct change can be given to every customer, and false otherwise.

// Input : bills = [5, 5, 10, 5, 20]
// Output : true
// Explanation : Initially we have $0 available for change.

// From first two customers, we will collect two $5 bills in order.
//  After the first two customers we have two $5 bills available with us for change.
// From the third customer , we collect bill of $10 and give back $5.
//  After third customer we have one $5 and one $10 bill available with us for change.
// From fourth customer , we collect $5 bill. 
// After fourth customer we have two $5 and one $10 bills available with us for change if required.
// From fifth customer , we collect bill of $20 and give back $15 (one $10 + one $5 bill).
// Since all the customers did receive the change correctly , so we return true.
